      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      AIR is a unique DeFi product that connects with a real-world asset which
      is experiencing unprecedented demand pressure across both voluntary
      markets and compliance markets. Even in the face of the COVID-fueled
      market crash of 2020, carbon markets pretty much walked away unscathed,
      have since seen strong demand growth, and are now entering a period of
      price discovery.
